I've been meaning to have a portable way of keeping track of my scores, and the sentiment goes to a bunch of others who play it. There are a couple of apps for this out already but I also wanted to have an AI function to it since the break time between songs is very short, inputting info needs to be done fast and simple. Frontend is using Xamarin UI framework. On the backend, AWS is used to image analyze photos and Realm as an offline database."
